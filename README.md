For this task, the Steam Online game dataset ("steam200k.csv") will be used. It includes
user purchases, playtime, and IDs, providing feedback for a recommender system. The goal is to
load the data into a DataFrame, explore its structure, and build a recommender using MLlib's
collaborative filtering. Preprocessing data and generating integer IDs for users and games are
challenges to address to integrate them smoothly which needs to be devised.
